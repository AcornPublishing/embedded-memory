* CLOCK PROJECT MAKER * by Kris Kaspersky Version 1.0 beta AT 23-07-2001
(utility for the "Code Optimization: Effective Memory Usage" book)
========================================================================

   1) Open the clock.make.bat and clock.clear.bat files and find the 
"SET  %CLOCKSDK%" string. Correct the path to the "CPU.CLOCK.SDK" profiler 
_without_ terminating it by a slash.
(You can also delete this line and create a new environment variable
with the same name in the system)

   2) Copy the clock.make.bat  and  clock.clear.bat  to any directory
specified by the PATH environment variable.

   3) Install MASM 6.13 macro assembler and Microsoft  Visual  C++ 6.0
(the next version is planned to include support for other
assemblers/compilers)

   4) I am not sure that clock.make.bat will run under systems
other than Windows 2000 due to the usage of filename extensions.
If this is the case, find all "%~n1" strings and replace them by "%1".
Bear in mind that in this case you'll have to specify the project
filename without extension in the command line.
For example: clock.make.bat TEST
